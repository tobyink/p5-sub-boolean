=head1 NAME

Sub::Boolean - make XS true/false subs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More;
  use Sub::Boolean qw( make_true );
  
  make_true( __PACKAGE__ . "::foobar" );
  
  ok( foobar(),    'returns true' );
  ok( foobar(123), 'returns true' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A good way to create fast true/false constants is:

  use constant { true => !!1, false => !!0 };

Or on newer Perls:

  use builtin qw( true false );

However these constants will throw a compile-time error if you call them
as a sub:

  if ( true(123) ) {
    ...;
  }

Sub::Boolean allows you to create subs which return true or false fast
as they're implemented in XS.

As a bonus, it can also generate subs which return undef or the empty list.

Each function created by this module will have a different refaddr, which 
means that using things like C<set_prototype> or C<set_subname> on one will
not affect others.

Boolean functions are really unlikely to be a bottleneck in most
applications, so the use cases for this module are very limited.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Nothing is exported unless requested.

=head2 C<< make_true( $qualified_name ) >>

Given a fully qualified sub name, installs a sub something like:

  sub $qualified_name {
    return !!1;
  }

=head2 C<< make_false( $qualified_name ) >>

Given a fully qualified sub name, installs a sub something like:

  sub $qualified_name {
    return !!0;
  }

=head2 C<< make_undef( $qualified_name ) >>

Given a fully qualified sub name, installs a sub something like:

  sub $qualified_name {
    return undef;
  }

=head2 C<< make_empty( $qualified_name ) >>

Given a fully qualified sub name, installs a sub something like:

  sub $qualified_name {
    return ();
  }
